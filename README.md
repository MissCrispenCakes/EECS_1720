commits made while instructing EECS 1720 (winter 2022) (course @York University, Canada)
- live content will be cleaned, edited, and described in logfile and code comments each week on Thursday
- don't worry about the GitHub CLI (command line interface) files.. we will look at git and/or gh during Week 2 
- it's there if you're interested though

## what's new

>>  for now we will run and edit python sketches from within the Processing Development Environment (PDE)
>>  
> p5js for processing is in P5JS/
>> this is a bit more work to set up as we will run our own http-servers
>> for now you can copy the sketch code into the p5.js editor on the website and start playing around
