# THIS IS SAVED AS A TEXT FILE BUT YOU CAN ENABLE COLOUR SPECIFIC SYNTAX TO HELP READ THE INFORMATION
# CLICK ON ^VIEW IN SUBLIME MENU - LOOK FOR 'SYNTAX' - IT IS ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE LIST OF OPTIONS - EXPAND THE SYNTAX OPTION AND SELECT "BASH" (ONE OF THE FIRST FEW LANGUAGE OPTIONS)
# YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW BASH - IT IS JUST A WAY TO SEE THE INFORMATION THAT IS IN THIS FILE WITH APPROPRIATE COLOUR DISTICTIONS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMANDS, STEPS, AND COMMENTS 
#
#
# USEFUL LINKS TO GET COMMAND LINE INTERFACE RUNNING - GITHUB
# WE WILL LOOK AT USER INTERFACES WEEK 2 SO DON'T WORRY IF YOU HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE

#
# PATH-TO: WHERE P5JS FOLDER IS LOCATED
# THIS IS FOR LINUX BUT WINDOWS SIMILAR - I'LL UPDATE OVER THE WEEKEND (HOPEFULLY)

# THE CODE ABOVE WILL CHECK PERMISSIONS AND UPDATE NPM (NODE PACKAGE MANAGER) SO WE CAN RUN A SERVER WITH BROWSER-SYNC
# THIS WILL LET US WORK LOCALLY IN REAL TIME - IF YOU UPDATE AND SAVE A FILE (INDEX.HTML, SERVER.JS) IT WILL AUTO-REFRESH THE BROWSER/WEBSITE 
#
# OPEN YOUR DEFAULT BROWSER AND GO TO "http://localhost:3000/client"
# ^^ ASSUMING YOU NAMED YOUR FOLDERS THE SAME AS MINE FROM THE GITHUB REPO P5JS > client
# RUN THE BROWSER-SYNC FROM THE ROOT FOLDER "P5JS"/ .. POINT YOUR BROWSER TO THE FOLDER WITH THE CODE 'client/'
