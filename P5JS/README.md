## p5.js

This file stores the complete p5.js library. It is easy to read by humans, so feel free to open it and explore its contents. It also has a friendly error system, which helps new programmers with common user errors.

## p5.min.js

This file is a minified version of the p5.js file. It is a lighter version, with the same functionalities, but smaller file size. This minified version is harder to read for humans, and does not include the friendly error system.

## addons folder

The addons folder includes additional p5.js related libraries, in both original versions and minified versions.

### p5.sound.js, p5.sound.min.js

p5.sound extends p5.js with Web Audio functionality including audio input, playback, analysis, and synthesis.

## client folder

This is an example of a website. The folder includes the file for the website, index.html, and a template starting point for your p5.js sketch, called sketch.js.

### index.html

index.html is a template for an HTML file. This index.html first imports the libraries included in the folder (p5.js, p5.sound.js) then loads and executes the file sketch.js which is where you can write your own code.

### sketch.js

The sketch.js is a template for the p5.js sketch, with the functions setup() and draw() that you can complete.
